# PhyCHarm
PhyCHarm is an MR physics-based harmonization framework for multisite and multiscanner MR dataset.

  
## Environment setup
To setup your environment, please use the ['environment.yaml'](https://github.com/HUFS-AIIMST/PhyCHarm/blob/0371710f9da5d2e1d937e35b033a54cf1e90b854/environment.yaml) configuration file.


## Inference
To run inference for harmonization, use the [inference.py](https://github.com/HUFS-AIIMST/PhyCHarm/blob/0371710f9da5d2e1d937e35b033a54cf1e90b854/Code/Harmonization_Network/inference.py) of the Harmonization_Network directory in Code.
To run inference for the Quantitative Maps Generator only, use the [inference.ipynb](https://github.com/HUFS-AIIMST/PhyCHarm/blob/0371710f9da5d2e1d937e35b033a54cf1e90b854/Code/Quantitative_Maps_Generator/inference.ipynb) of the Quantitative_Maps_Generator directory in Code.
